# Statistics Problem 1
Implement a function that takes a vector of numbers as an input and outputs the values
needed to plot the boxplot. Specifically, the function should output the 1st quartile (q1), 2nd
quartile (q2), 3rd quartile (q3), the inter-quartile range, a vector containing the outlier
points and the vector containing the extreme outlier points. 
Deliverables:
â€¢ The values of q1, q2, q3, inter-quartile range, outlier points, and extreme outlier
points.
